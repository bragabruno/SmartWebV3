## Collaboration Guidelines

1. **Daily Standups**: Each team member reports on their assigned tickets
2. **Code Reviews**: Senior engineers review junior work; cross-review between teams
3. **Pair Programming**: 
   - SWE-1 with SWE-7 on architecture tasks
   - SWE-2 with SWE-8 on backend tasks
   - SWE-3 with SWE-6 on frontend tasks
4. **Knowledge Sharing**: Weekly tech talks on complex implementations
5. **Blocker Resolution**: Escalate to SWE-1 or appropriate senior engineer

## Success Metrics

- **Velocity**: Track story points completed per sprint
- **Quality**: Code coverage > 80%, zero critical bugs in production
- **Timeline**: Complete MVP in 8-12 months
- **Collaboration**: All P0 tickets have documented solutions

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Single Point of Failure**: Each critical component has a backup assignee
2. **Knowledge Silos**: Documentation requirements for all P0 tickets
3. **Dependencies**: Weekly dependency review meetings
4. **Scope Creep**: Strict change control process via SWE-1

## Notes

- Ticket assignments consider individual expertise and career growth
- P0 tickets distributed among senior engineers for critical path items
- Junior engineers paired with seniors for mentorship
- DevOps and QA integrated throughout rather than at end
